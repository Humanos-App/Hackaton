The contract enables users to grant consent to other users or institutions, allowing them temporary visual access to their data. This consent specifies the type of data being shared and the recipient (hash), and the exact start and end times of the access (ConsentTimestamps).

Users also have the ability to extend or revoke active consents as needed.

This system provides a flexible and straightforward method for creating decentralized consent, empowering users with greater control over their data.
