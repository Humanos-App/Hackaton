# Humanos - Consent Engine

Humanos is a blockchain-enabled consent engine that allows individuals to securely share their health data between public and private entities, ensuring full control, transparency, and GDPR-compliance.

## How It Works

Our contract enables users to grant consent to other users or institutions, allowing them temporary visual access to their data. This consent specifies:

- The type of data being shared
- The recipient (hash)
- The exact start and end times of the access (ConsentTimestamps)

Users also have the ability to extend or revoke active consents as needed.

This system provides a flexible and straightforward method for creating decentralized consent, empowering users with greater control over their data.
